I am a computer engineer working in the fields of **perception** and **computer vision**.

I am currently employed as a software engineer specializing in developing real-time algorithms for vision systems. My expertise lies in writing high-performance C++ code optimized for edge devices, particularly embedded platforms (NVIDIA Jetson).

My background is in computer science and software engineering, holding a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering. In the past I have worked as a machine learning researcher for vision and remote sensing.
